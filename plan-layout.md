# Plan for Windows Speech-to-Text App Using whisper.cpp

## 1. Objectives
- Build a desktop application for Windows that provides accurate, offline speech-to-text transcription.
- Use the whisper.cpp project as the core engine for model inference.
- Offer an intuitive graphical interface that supports real-time microphone input and file transcription.

## 2. Repository Familiarization
1. **Core library** – `src/whisper.cpp` and public headers in `include/whisper.h` implement model loading, audio preprocessing, inference, and result handling.
2. **GGML backend** – the `ggml` folder offers tensor and computation primitives enabling cross-platform CPU/GPU acceleration.
3. **Examples** – `examples/cli` demonstrates CLI usage; `examples/stream` and `examples/command` show real-time microphone capture and basic voice assistant behaviour.
4. **Models** – scripts in `models/` download and convert pre-trained weights to GGML format.
5. **Tests** – `tests/run-tests.sh` provides integration testing by transcribing reference audio and comparing output.

## 3. Development Environment
- **Toolchain**: Visual Studio 2022 with CMake and MSVC; alternatively, MinGW or clang on Windows.
- **Dependencies**: none at runtime—whisper.cpp is standalone. For audio capture and UI, use Win32 APIs or libraries like PortAudio and a GUI framework (WinUI 3 / WPF / Qt).
- **Model files**: provide scripts or built-in downloader to fetch GGML models and optional VAD model.

## 4. Building whisper.cpp on Windows
1. Install Visual Studio with Desktop development workload.
2. Clone the whisper.cpp repository and open a Developer Command Prompt.
3. Configure and build:
   ```batch
   cmake -B build -A x64
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```
4. The resulting `whisper.dll` (or static library) will be used by the application; binaries for CLI examples help in testing.

## 5. Application Architecture
- **Frontend**: Windows GUI (WinUI/WPF/Qt) with controls for recording, transcribing files, settings, and output viewer.
- **Backend**: C++ layer wrapping whisper.cpp API. Expose high-level functions:
  - load_model(path)
  - transcribe_file(path)
  - start_microphone_stream()
  - stop_microphone_stream()
  - callbacks delivering partial/final transcripts.
- **Audio Capture**: use Win32 `waveIn*` APIs, WASAPI, or a cross‑platform library like PortAudio or miniaudio. Convert audio to 16 kHz mono PCM before sending to whisper.cpp.
- **Threading**: run inference on a worker thread; use message queue or async callbacks to update UI without blocking.

## 6. Features and Workflow
1. **Model Management**
   - On first launch, prompt for model size (tiny/base/small/…).
   - Download selected GGML model using scripts converted to Windows `.cmd` or embedded HTTP client.
   - Cache models locally and allow switching via settings.
2. **File Transcription**
   - Provide “Open Audio” dialog; convert non‑WAV files using bundled ffmpeg or Windows Media APIs.
   - Display transcribed text with timestamps; allow export to .txt or .srt.
3. **Real‑Time Microphone Transcription**
   - Start audio capture, run VAD (optional) to segment speech, and feed frames to whisper.cpp in streaming mode (see `examples/stream`).
   - Show interim and final results; offer copy/share buttons.
4. **Language and Translation Options**
   - Auto detect language or allow manual selection.
   - Support translation to English using whisper.cpp translation features.
5. **User Experience**
   - Responsive UI, progress indicators, error messages.
   - Settings for thread count, GPU acceleration (if using Vulkan/OpenVINO), hotkeys, and automatic updates.

## 7. Packaging and Distribution
- Bundle required DLLs and a minimal model (e.g., tiny.en) so the app works offline immediately.
- Provide installer (MSIX or Inno Setup) that also fetches larger models on demand.
- Sign binaries for Windows SmartScreen.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Add transcription history and search.
- Integrate with Windows Speech Recognition APIs for fallback.
- Provide plug‑ins or REST API for other applications.
- Explore GPU/Vulkan backend for faster inference on supported hardware.

## 9. Milestones
1. Proof of concept: command‑line Windows build using whisper.cpp.
2. GUI prototype with file transcription.
3. Real‑time microphone streaming with VAD.
4. Polished UX, settings, and installer.
5. Public release and feedback iteration.

## 10. Considering Electron
- **Pros**
  - Single code base can target Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - UI built with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) enabling rapid prototyping and large ecosystem of libraries.
  - Node.js integration simplifies scripting tasks such as model downloads or update checks.
- **Cons**
  - Heavier runtime (Chromium + Node) increases installer size and memory usage compared to a native Windows-only app.
  - Requires native module bridge to invoke whisper.cpp, adding complexity and potential performance overhead.
  - Packaging and auto-update flows demand additional tooling (e.g., electron-builder) and code signing for each platform.
